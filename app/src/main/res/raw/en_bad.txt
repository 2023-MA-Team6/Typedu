Bad-Christopher 
I'm not trying to be dramatic
But I need someone
Who can take a little heat
You wanted thunder now you have it
I want a boyfriend
Who can handle all of me
It feels like
Yesterday
Yesterday
Yesterday
We were making out
And reaching for the stars
But Not today
Not today
Not today
'Cause you
Now you say you wanna
Bad boy
All the good girls think they need a
Bad boy
And all this time I've tried not to be a
Bad boy
What they really do shit
I'm not good at being cool
When it comes to you
When it comes to you
When it comes to you
When it comes to you
First you're running me over
Then you like why you making a scene
Are you gonna blame this on me
Don't be acting all sweet to get to my head
And then just go mean
Look what you're doing to me
It feels like yesterday
Yesterday
Yesterday
We were making out
And reaching for the stars
But not today
Not today
Not today
'Cause you
Now I say I wanna
Bad boy
All the good girls think they need a
Bad boy
And all this time I've tried not to be a
Bad boy
What they really do shit
I'm not good at being cool
When it comes to you
When it comes to you
When it comes to you
When it comes to you
I cried my eyes out expecting reply
You send me snapchats
With some other guy
I'm done with heartaches
Done wastin my time on you
Now you say you wanna
Bad boy
All the good girls think they need a
Bad boy
And All this time I've tried not to be a
Bad boy
What they really do shit
I'm not good at being cool
When it comes to you
When it comes to you
When it comes to you
When it comes to you
